Fuzzy Logic System Description for Computer Graphics Evaluation
This work proposes a fuzzy logic system for determining a student's standing in a Computer Graphics course. It considers various factors that influence student performance and engagement, including:

Number of Absences: A student's attendance is a crucial indicator of their dedication and commitment to the course.

Grades on Assessments: A student's performance in exams, assignments, and other assessments reflects their level of knowledge and understanding of the covered concepts.

Classroom Presence: Active participation in class is essential for student learning and content absorption.

Activity Participation: A student's involvement in activities like seminars, study groups, and projects demonstrates their interest and proactiveness in the course.

Number of Classroom Exits: The frequency of a student leaving the classroom during lectures might indicate disinterest or difficulty keeping up.

Lateness: A student's punctuality reflects respect for their instructors and peers, along with their organization and planning skills.

By combining these variables, the fuzzy logic system can identify patterns and complex relationships between them, enabling a more holistic and accurate evaluation of a student's situation. Fuzzy logic takes into account the imprecise and subjective nature of some factors, such as activity participation and demonstrated interest, allowing for a more comprehensive and fair analysis.
